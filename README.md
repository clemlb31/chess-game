LE BERRE Cl√©ment

Program separated into 3 classes: Game, Piece and Square.

The Game class contains the game grid, the pieces and all methods except those that depend on each piece.
The chess game is managed by the Game class and is handled turn by turn by alternating players.
The Piece class contains the attributes of each piece, its coordinates and the movement it can perform.
The Square class contains a pointer to the room it contains as well as the character to display on the grid.
Pieces and squares are stored in vectors in the Game class.

If a piece is eliminated, it is placed at coordinates (-1,-1) and is no longer taken into account in the possible movements,
so that it can be eliminated by the Game class destructor.

The program has been tested with valgrind and shows no memory leaks.
